# Gray-Scott Visualization Fix

## Error Description

The original clustering visualization script was failing with the error:

```
ValueError: 'c' argument has 375 elements, which is inconsistent with 'x' and 'y' with size 188.
```

This error occurs in matplotlib's scatter plot function when the array of colors (`c`) has a different length than the arrays of x and y coordinates.

## Fix Approach

The fix_clustering.py script addresses this issue by:

1. Loading the existing clustering data from `grayscott_clusters.csv`
2. Ensuring all arrays (features, parameters, and clusters) have the same length
3. Recreating the visualizations with properly aligned data
4. Saving the results as new files to avoid modifying the original data

## Files Created

- `gif/gif_clusters_tsne_fixed.png`: Fixed t-SNE visualization with cluster colors
- `gif/gif_clusters_params_fixed.png`: Fixed parameter space visualization with cluster colors
- `gif/grayscott_clusters_fixed.csv`: Fixed CSV data with properly aligned entries

## Using the Fix

1. The fix has already been applied successfully
2. The new visualization files are in the `gif` directory
3. You can run the script again if needed with `./fix_clustering.py`

## Technical Details

The issue was caused by a mismatch in array lengths in the original code:
- The `param_values` array had 188 elements (representing the unique parameter combinations)
- The `clusters` array had 375 elements (representing all the GIF files)

The fix ensures all arrays are truncated to the same length before visualization.
